# Cargo Report Generator

The Cargo Report Generator is a Python program designed to scrape cargo data from a specific 
airline and reformat it into an Excel spreadsheet based on the report selected by the user.

This project was created to address the lack of a proper report generation feature on the 
airlineâ€™s cargo website. By automating this task, the program streamlines the process and 
saves time for the user.
